it is the beginning of the month, so you know what that means. new fun challenges and a new fun hackathon has been released. head on over to the fun challenges page to check them out!

hp enterprise is running an ideation challenge called the living progress challenge. the goal is to improve the lives of 1 million people by 2020. they say that millions of people who can't access the power of technology are getting left behind and they are looking for ideas of software applications and digital services that can help them. check out the site for more information and to learn about the different prizes you can win!

do you remember seeing a bunch of those sunshot challenges that have been popping up the past couple months? well, all of that work is going to be on display as you all were contributing to projects of 19 different teams. these teams will be demoing your work on december 10th in philadelphia, pennsylvania! good work, everyone.
