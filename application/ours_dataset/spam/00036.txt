hour of drawing with code: learn to program drawings using javascript, one of the world's most popular programming languages, via two great options:

typing: keyboard-based coding (ages 10+).
drag-and-drop: block-based coding for those with less typing experience or on ipads/tablets (ages 8+).
hour of webpages: learn to make your own webpages using the basics of html and css (ages 10+).
