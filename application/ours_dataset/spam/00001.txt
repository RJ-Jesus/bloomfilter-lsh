happy friday, devs!

have you been keeping up with the topcoder weekly episodes? this week's show is star wars themed as there is a fun contest on our facebook page where members like you are coming up with slogans that are topcoder and star wars related. i see t-shirts in our future!

the episode also features will giammona, who is our director of community education and recognition. he talks about #swiftoberfest, how to get started in the ios community, earning badges, and how to win amazing prizes. this campaign only lasts until the end of the year, so if you haven't joined already, do it now! the ios community will live on but the prizes will not.

as always, we have three great challenges to highlight and some blog posts that may interest you. keep in mind that some of the challenges end this weekend, so keep an eye on that.

until next time!
