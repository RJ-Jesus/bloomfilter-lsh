hi rj.bcjesus,

as you may know, khan academy is a small nonprofit with a big mission: a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. it's an ambitious goal, and we rely on donations from people like you to keep working toward it.

if all of you pitched in just $3, it would fund all of our work for the next year.

make your gift today

all gifts made in december are being matched by a group of our supporters, so i hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity to pitch in and double your impact.

your support will help us keep building free content and making the site even better for millions of learners around the world.

all the best,

sal khan
founder, khan academy
for free, for everyone, forever.
