start your hour of code

a worldwide movement

brooklyn and chicago are going head-to-head in a competition to reach more students. in nigeria and syria, students are coding amidst the violence. russia and italy asked every school to host an hour of code. in zimbabwe, guam, colombia, france, malta, afghanistan — in every country — students are learning skills that can change the rest of their lives.
