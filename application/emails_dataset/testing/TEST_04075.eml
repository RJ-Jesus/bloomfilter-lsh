Hi,
I'm considering purchasing a new laptop like this one
http://www.thelinuxlaptop.com/viper-linux-laptop.php which uses a Dell
Wireless 1490 card a.k.a. bcm4310.  I've used b43-fwcutter with great
results on older dell bcm43xx cards in Lenny but bcm4310 is not listed here
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#Supported_chip_types.  I'm
also curious about the video card (intel graphics media accelerator x4500hd)
but that appears to be supported based on what I've read.
Does anyone have additional information or suggestions?  Any help is
appreciated.
Thank you,
Mark
