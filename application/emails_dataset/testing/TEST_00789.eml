Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using
C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
caching for you.
I do not think this is possible in C, though?
You could write the same code fragment as:
============================
for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a
