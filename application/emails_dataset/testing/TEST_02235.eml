CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email
Saturday, July 13, 2002
If you've ever taped a "Seinfeld" episode or traded music online, Uncle =
Sam may want you--to stop.
Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=
mit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=
erring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =
would limit backup copies, has drawn objections from academics =
and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.
Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=
ment generally may "sell or otherwise dispose of" that analog recording or =
digital file as they wish.
The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=
ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=
umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as "fair use."
Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=
id that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copy=
right lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=
r Kazaa software.
The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=
ation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies =
in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=
works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=
 created the Kazaa software.
However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=
rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=
e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=
sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=
at Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.
Shoring up U.S. security 
Computer security is becoming increasingly critical to Presiden=
t Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro=
posed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call=
ed cybersecurity.
 
But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou=
t tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite=
d States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm=
ittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end =
of the week.
Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=
rnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio=
n functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran=
ce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St=
andards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.
Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own priv=
acy czar. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that =
the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure=
 that new technologies "sustain and do not erode" privacy protections and t=
o verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli=
nes.
Who's running your computer? 
Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o=
n now with their computers.
Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers piggyback malicious cod=
e on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to=
 the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i=
nstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke=
r to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.
The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me=
chanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco=
rding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do=
wnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a =
system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.
Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica=
tions may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw =
that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o=
r in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company =
PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co=
uld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, =
read their documents and execute programs on their computer.
Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user=
s encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye =
Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ=
ates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab=
ility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic=
tim's computer.
Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone
One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=
 wireless networking technology has made its debut. IQinVision =
plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=
ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=
tall a temporary security system.
This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =
wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=
d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =
cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=
a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi is also invading handheld devices. Wireless equipment mak=
er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=
ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=
d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=
rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =
to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=
ompanies.
Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=
wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=
pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=
 card, wireless access becomes an option for many.
Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=
king. Broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, =
threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=
tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi "hot spo=
ts" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=
st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =
can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=
et, for fun or for profit.
News.com special focus: China
As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is=
 becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the gl=
obal recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerge=
d as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part special report examines the various reasons that this may eventually b=
e known as China's high-tech century.
Also of note
Apple Computer plans to serve up a new iMac model with a larger fla=
t-panel display during next week's Macworld Expo trade show...Microsoft=
 joined the growing customer relationship management market by prev=
iewing its first CRM product...America Online has quietly been testing an update to its popular AOL Instant Messenger, using graphics=
 to create personal looks reminiscent of Yahoo's chat features...Federal re=
gulators deactivated hundreds of thousands of credit cards belo=
nging to former customers of NextCard...IBM's hard drive business, which th=
e company is selling to Hitachi, lost $515 million in the five =
most recent quarters...Yahoo reported its first profit in six q=
uarters but found it difficult to assuage analysts' concerns about its core=
 advertising business.
