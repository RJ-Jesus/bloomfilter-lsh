Dear Reader,
Personal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost 
any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as 
$199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a 
good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive 
models will suit students or home users who need to print letters 
or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks. 
In pricier models, vendors typically add more RAM, higher-capacity 
paper trays, duplexing capabilities, and networking options for 
corporate and small-business users. 
Check out a few of our favorites below and find the laser printer
with the right price and features for you!
