I decided to follow Piotr's example and switched to Xfwm (I first
tried to completely switch to Xfce, but seriouslyâ¦panels meeting in a
corner overlap each other?!) and after some fiddling I'm now happy
with it â it behaves nearly exactly the same way Metacity used to
behave and I have the bell. The only thing I miss is the
Glider-theme :/
Best regards and thank you again,
Claudius
