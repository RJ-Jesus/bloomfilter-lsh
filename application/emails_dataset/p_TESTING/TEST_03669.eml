Not quite true.  If the data in a sector was not readable, the sector 
will be listed as "Pending".  Pending sectors are much worse than 
Reallocated sectors, as Pending sectors mean lost data (if the sector 
was in actual use, which SMART does not know -- and figuring out which 
file might have been affected is, umm, tedious).
I keep SMART's Offline Surface Scan enabled on my drives, to have the 
best chance that any failing sectors will be noticed early while they 
can still be recovered.  I don't mind if there are a few Reallocated 
sectors, as long as there are never any Pending sectors.  I'd mind if 
the number of Reallocated sectors kept increasing.  Of course, I also 
keep backups.

Or at least normally won't, unless Data Has Been Lost.

Agree.  Use smartctl.
