_Sam Ruby_: Stark raving mad[1]. 
    This post was entered in Radio, extracted using a batch file via some 
    UserTalk, parsed using Perl, cleaned up by tidy and a C program of my own 
    design, transferred to intertwingly using scp, and then ssh triggers 
    unpacking on the destination site, where a shell script takes over: invokes 
    indexing using Jakarta's Lucene, and then a python script pings weblogs.com 
    and blo.gs. 
Tom Stoppard (_Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_): 
    Guildenstern: âA man talking sense to himself is no madder than a man 
    talking nonsense not to himself.â
    Rosencrantz: âOr just as mad.â
    Guildenstern: âOr just as mad.â
    Rosencrantz: âAnd he does both.â
    Guildenstern: âSo there you are.â
    Rosencrantz: âStark raving sane.â
