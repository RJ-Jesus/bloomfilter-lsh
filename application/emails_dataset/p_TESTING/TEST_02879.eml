I really doubt that! /bin/sh should be a symbolic link (symlink) to 
either /bin/bash or /bin/dash (depending on the release you are using).

Of course, /bin/sh is needed for the basic operation of your OS, it 
couldn't reside on /usr (which is often a separate partition mounted 
later on).
Try putting this in ~/.bashrc:
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
