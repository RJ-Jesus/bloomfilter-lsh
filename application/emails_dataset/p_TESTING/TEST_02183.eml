 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of Germanyâs political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlerâs personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the FÃ¼hrer. 
 
 âEdmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor,â said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. âChancellor SchrÃ¶der is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,â said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. âMany thanks for your nice
 thoughts,â replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of Hitlerâs book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 âThe strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,â
 the letter-writer said. âSo-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun.â Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaderâs words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. âI read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure,â the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 âGreat that you want to join us!â enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, the Chancellor. 
 
 âI wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism,â said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. âI had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 âFor the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called â with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters,â Herr Popp said. 
 
 âI was stunned that political parties could react in this way â I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter âAdolf Hitlerâ.â
