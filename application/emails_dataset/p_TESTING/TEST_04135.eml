SUBJECT: [Razor-users] Re: Content-Type: message/rfc822  supported ?

Not sure what you're asking.  
  Content-Type: message/rfc822 mails are handled like attachments
  and are not broken down further into mime parts.  That is, the attachment
  is treated as one part.  The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are
  sent to the server without parsing.  The other way to handle it is to treat it like
  a regular mail, and break it down into parts.
  
  There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right 
  now we chose not to break it down.  This might change in the future.
