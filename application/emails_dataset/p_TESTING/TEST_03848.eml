On my little VM I have 294 packages installed, 277 marked as automatically 
installed.
I find that the more packages are automatically installed, the easier upgrades 
are, since aptitude seems more willing to preform a library transition on a 
"automatically installed" package.
I try to only keep packages I know I am using un-marked.
