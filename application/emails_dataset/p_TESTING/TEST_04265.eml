Yes, that's found it!  It appears that Netbeans explicitly sets -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 in the java command line, whereas Xcode doesn't.  The presence of this command option causes the problem.  By default, Java on Mac appears to use "MacRoman" as the file encoding.
An apparent fix in Netbeans is to go to the project's Properties > Run page and set the VM Options to -Dfile.encoding=MacRoman
At first sight, this appears to fix the problem but I need to make more tests to be sure; I may come back if I find further issues.   Incidentally, trying to set the option with a System.setProperty () call didn't work.
Thanks to everyone who helped
