Dear Dr. Ban,
The creation of the world's fastest physical random number generator, the 
report of nonlinear optics in doped silica glass, and the observation of 
slow light in a long chain of coupled photonic crystal cavities are just 
three of the achievements reported in the December issue of Nature Photonics 
http://scientific-direct.net/c.asp?741452&41248fb1d7ff79fc&2
  
The issue also features a review article on ceramic laser materials which 
are poised to become an attractive gain medium for high-power solid-state 
lasers, and an article looking at how photonics is changing the world of dentistry. 
To accompany this, we have our usual high-quality mix of news, expert insights 
and research highlights from the world of optics. Take a peek inside.
