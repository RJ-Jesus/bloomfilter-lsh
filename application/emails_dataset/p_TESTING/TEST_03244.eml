That's because ">& build.log" is a bash-ism.  If dash is installed as /bin/sh 
(which is useful, since it executes the start-up scripts faster), you might 
get this error.
You probably want "> build.log 2>&1" which (one of?) the standard, POSIX/SUS-
compatible way of re-directing both stdout and stderr to a single file named 
"build.log".  The ">&" shortcut that bash has is nice, but it is not portable.
The Single UNIX Specification, version 3 (and older versions) are available 
for free from the owner of the UNIX trademark.  Those documents can tell you 
what to expect from the shell on any certified UNIX system.  AFAIK, no Linux 
has been certified yet, but they still remain an excellent guideline for Linux 
systems.
