Thanks Allen
Incidentally, it turns out that Quicktime 10 / File / New Movie Recording DOES let the iSight camera see the iPad without the mirroring we suffered with using iChat.  The green button expands the image
You donât have to record, (although you could), but it works to the extent you can put the iSight camera on the iPad
