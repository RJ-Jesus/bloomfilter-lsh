I can't really help you with your problem, but would like to point out
that there is a mailing list for PowerPC [1], which might be worth a
try. And there are a couple of hits on Google for the error (prom-init
freeze) you get ... ;)
Are you using the squeeze installer? If so, I would try the stable
installer for the installation. Is there a special reason why you need
the squeeze installer? You can easily upgrade to squeeze later on or
oven install squeeze directly.
Good luck!
