SUBJECT: xorg synaptics driver no longer working with udev?

Hi list,
After a large set of updates today on testing, xorg no longer picks up
my udev rules file. A few months ago hal stopped working, as a change to
udev was required (see also the list history for several threads on that
topic). Now, udev stopped working? Did I miss any change to xorg
behaviour? I'm using the latest xorg and kdm/kde on testing.
