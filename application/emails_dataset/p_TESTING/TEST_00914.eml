You should look into the live-helper configuration and adjust where it gets 
the kernel source and any (extra?) patches it applies.  It should be able to 
work with kernel sources provided from lenny-backports with the proper 
configuration, since it already works with both Lenny and Squeeze kernel 
sources.  The bpo kernels are not packaged significantly differently.
If live-helper doesn't have any relevant configuration, looking into how it 
receives, patches, compiles, and packages the kernel should give you some 
insight into a work-around.  (e.g. repackaging the bpo kernel package to have 
the same package name but a higher version than the Lenny kernel package.)
