SSDs marketed for HD replacement do not need noatime.  They have re-write 
limits such that, if written to at maximum speed for the lifetime of a 
comparable HD, less than the number of reserved cells would fail and no data 
would be lost.  They are roughly 1.5 orders of magnitude more durable than 
"thumbdrives" -- they have to be to stand a MS Windows page file or a Linux 
swap partition/file.
noatime can increase performance, it does so by breaking the expectations of 
at least mutt (possibly others).  atime updates are a normal expectation, 
since they've been included in the documentation of dozens of UNIX system 
calls since before standardization started on POSIX.
relatime is a much better alternative and is roughly equivalent to the OS 
deciding to combine atime updates, which is explicitly allowed by the 
standards.
