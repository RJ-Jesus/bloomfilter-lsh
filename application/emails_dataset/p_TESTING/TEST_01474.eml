Sorry for CCing to you messages that are meant for you, Lisi. If you
haven't noticed the mailing list headers are broken and Reply sends
messages off list. Therefore I use Reply All and oh nos, you get CCed.
I apologize for sending to you "commands" in your personal folder to
tell me what is wrong with KDE 4 for you so that I might fix it. Fell
free to just plonk me away, I take no offence.
