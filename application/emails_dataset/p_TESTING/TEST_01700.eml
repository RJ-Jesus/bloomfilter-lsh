SUBJECT: plasma desktop changes positions of widgets after I moved them

Hi!
Did someone else notice this?
https://bugs.kde.org/232171
I wonder if this could be partly debian / ubuntu specific as Bojan 
commented that he couldn't find it on other distros. But then to what I 
know Debian and Ubuntu package KDE seperately. 
Ciao,
