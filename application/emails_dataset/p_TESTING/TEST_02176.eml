Default kernel settings where changed.  Java applications and some other 
applications are now binding to IPv6 only, instead of IPv4 and IPv6.  There's 
an open bug about it, IIRC.
I think it was changed in order to allow communication to/from IPv4-embedded-
in-IPv6 addresses over IPv6, which might be required from some environments to 
function correctly / optimally.  I'm very sketchy on the details because I 
haven't hit the bug myself.
