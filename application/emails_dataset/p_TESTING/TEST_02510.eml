Important Note to Our Newsletter Subscribers: 
	  WE strongly urges you to 
	  add us to your Safe Senders list. Even if you have consistently
	  received newsletters in the past, you should take this quick and easy step
	  to ensure receipt going forward. Many e-mail service providers -- in
	  particular Google Gmail and Yahoo -- are blocking mass mailings to their
	  users, even e-mails users have requested. Policies and practices change
	  from day to day; the only way to ensure that you receive all requested
	  newsletters now is to add us to your Safe Senders list. Regardless of your
	  service provider, please take a moment to 
	  do this today.
