A guy struck up a conversation with a young lady in a bar.  After a half
dozen drinks, he suggested they get their own bottle and retire to his
motel room, and she readily agreed. "Say, how old are you, anyway?" the
guy asked.
    "Thirteen," she replied with a shy smile. 
    "Thirteen?   Thirteen!?  My God, Girl!  Get your clothes back on at
once and get the hell out of here!  Are you crazy?" he thundered.
    Pausing at the door as she left, the girl smiled.  "Superstitious,
huh?"
