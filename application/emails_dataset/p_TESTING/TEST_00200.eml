Whether Akonadi works or not appears to be a game of roulette to me. 
Freshly since upgrading from KDE 4.4.3:
Bug 236535 -  sometimes can't open and log timezone and privilege tables
https://bugs.kde.org/236535
Bug 236538 -  often does not find resource agents on first start of Kontact
https://bugs.kde.org/236538
Bug 236539 -  dbus session bus not available on first start of Kontact - 
race condition?
https://bugs.kde.org/236539
I already grepped in ~/.local/share/contacts for contact information as 
Akonadi was not available and I didn't now it would be there when I start 
kontact again.
My address book as to be accessible *all of the time* without bombarding 
me with more and less cryptic error messages. There are about 15 self 
tests that might fail. I think Akonadi from KDE 4.4 depends on too many 
external factors that it just can't control fully.
But nonetheless: I think these issues should be fixed upstream. And I also 
don't what else Debian developers could do then to use KDEPIM from KDE 4.4 
if the freeze will really happen this summer. Shipping KDEPIM 4.3 with KDE 
4.4 might not be an option for Debian KDE developers, cause it abandoned 
by upstream already and all security fixes needs to be backported. Sure 
when KDE 4.5 is out the same happens to KDE 4.4, but at least it will 
contain the security and other fixes upto then. 
So either KDE project decides to fix any Akonadi related issues for KDE 4.4 
series or Debian extends freeze. Other options would be: Shipping a KDE 
4.5 backport or even Squeeze + 1 shortly afterwards.
Ciao,
