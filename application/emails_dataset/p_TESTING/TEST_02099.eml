wicd used to conflict with network-manager, but not anymore:
wicd (1.6.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low
  [...]
  * debian/control:
    - remove Conflict on network-manager, since both can be used at
      the same time, provided they don't try to control the same
      interface (Closes: #548978)
There may be valid use cases for this.

You could file a whishlist bug on these:
$ aptitude search '?recommends(network-manager-kde)'
p   education-standalone                                               - Debian Edu standalone workstation packages                                   
p   kde-standard                                                       - the KDE Plasma Desktop and standard set of applications                      
p   knm-runtime                                                        - KDE NetworkManagement infrastructure runtime files                           
p   network-manager                                                    - network management framework daemon                                          
so they
Recommend: network-manager-kde | wicd-gtk
Unfortunately there is no wicd-qt package and I doubt the KDE 
maintainers will want to 'Recommend' a GTK package, especially since it 
isn't that hard to override.

I agree with you, but in this particular case it is not a 'Depends' it 
is a 'Recommends', and testing/unstable users should know how to 
override those.
