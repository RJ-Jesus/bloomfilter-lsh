That does not seem to be entirely true as was mentioned elsewhere in this 
thread:
http://trinity.pearsoncomputing.net/
However this seems far away from the man-power behind KDE 3 until 3.5.10. 
To truly get forward with this one it appears to me that way more 
developers are needed. Who then would have less or no time to work on 
improving KDE 4.
I will stick with KDE 4 - as long as it - as a whole - does get better 
from release to release. It already got better. It already takes longer 
than with KDE 3 to get as stable and nice to work with as KDE 3.5.10, but 
with help of everyone it eventually will get there. And KDE 3.5.10 had 
issues as well. Especially with KMail that Boyd is so interested in. KMail 
as of KDE 4.3 *and* 4.4 appears to be way more stable to me regarding that 
annoying index handling issues. And it has been improved a lot by Thomas 
McGuire and others. Okular is fine, Dolphin is fine, KWrite, Kate are fine, 
Dragon player is quite fine, Amarok is quite fine lots of other apps are 
fine. I think mainly Akonadi, Nepomuk, Plasma, a bit also Phonon needs 
quite some more stabilization and performance work.
