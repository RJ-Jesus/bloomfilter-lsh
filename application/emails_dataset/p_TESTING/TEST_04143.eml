I prefer the old software to the current alternative (and already have the licenses), and the SGI platform is so reliable. The computers are at least 12 years old and the Bruker XwinNMR program, was replaced about 5-6 years ago!

Are you experiencing problems when you set the X11 color depth to 256 colors in the preferences?
I think the instructions may still be valid.  I'm not 100% positive, though.  You can also try the package I made a while back:
http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11_Legacy-1.1.4.1.pkg
http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11_Legacy.README
I think there may be a problem with the quartz-wm in that package, but it should work ok if you use Snow Leopard's quartz-wm instead.
This is really not a supported approach, but hopefully it'll help.  If you have any problems, let me know, and I'll try to help.
