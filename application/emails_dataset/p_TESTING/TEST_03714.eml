When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the 
unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 
90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of 
things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is 
it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? 
Omaha has started a 10 
year project on Dodge street, which more or less divides 
the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to 
the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt 
by nearby businesses. A bank 
is fighting back in a creative way, replacing random $20 
and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes 
respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. 
And I just drove right by the place.
The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better 
right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between 
Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 
20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress 
they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's 
probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen 
during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you 
travel to Gnomedex 
from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on 
construction at this handy 
site put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation.
 
See You in Des Moines,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/l2tpclient.asp
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client is a free download that 
allows computers running Windows 98, Windows Millennium 
Edition (Me), or Windows NTÃ Workstation 4.0 to use Layer 
Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connections with Internet 
Protocol security (IPSec). The combination of L2TP and 
IPSec, known as L2TP/IPSec, is a highly secure technology 
for making remote access virtual private network (VPN) 
connections across public networks such as the Internet. 
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client also provides support for 
IPSec Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.

Iomega Intros 750MB Zip
http://www.iomega.com/zip
I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost 
and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip 
drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to 
time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and 
media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has 
bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed 
the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's 
still worth a look for those that need a fast removable 
media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice 
some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's 
just me.

Technical Overview of .NET File Services
http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx
.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of 
Windows XP, of that you can be sure. Common sense has 
finally won, with the developers delivering many more 
command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this 
isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. 
Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the 
surface. New WHQL processes are being established for 
antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the 
OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and 
promised improvements in the File Replication Service should 
make managing storage easier and more flexible.

P4 Performance Goes to Court
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp
A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a 
small group of PC owners that are miffed about the 
performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP 
and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the 
overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem 
to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on 
the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of 
those subjective questions that will come down to fancy 
lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed 
everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants 
got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the 
next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This 
general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, 
as have crash test results on the part of the government and 
third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers 
when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will 
save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable 
expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education.
