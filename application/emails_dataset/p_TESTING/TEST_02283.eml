 From the symptoms you describe, and ruling out bad RAM (you HAVE of  
course checked for bad RAM, haven't you?), my first guess would be "an  
aging optical drive, combined with a flakily burnt CD". Such  
combinations can prove hard to overcome. Suggestions: temporarily  
installing a newer optical drive into the box; or burning another CD,  
preferably on a different drive/machine, and on different brand of  
media, and at the slowest burning rate available; or perhaps, for the  
adventurous at heart, even asking uncle Google about "installing Debian  
directly from an ISO file on the hard drive, without burning a CD".
