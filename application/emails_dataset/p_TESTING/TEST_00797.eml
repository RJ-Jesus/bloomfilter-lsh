It's generally referred to as a "mixed" system.  Most "mixed" systems are 
neither tested nor officially supported.  They can still be quite useful.
Adding backports as a source is *almost* supported.  Backports is not an 
official service for Lenny, but I think there was some work to make it 
official for Squeeze or Squeeze+1.
In practice, using stable/backports is _vastly_ superior to trying to use a 
mixed stable/testing system.  Unless you've already been playing with pinning, 
you should simply be able to add backports to your sources.list.  Only the 
packages you specifically request from backports will be installed.

The order the lines appear in the file does not affect what versions of a 
package will be installed.  (It *might* affect which mirror is tried first, 
but I don't think even that is guaranteed.)
You'll want to look into (man 5 apt_preferences) if you want to run a mixed 
system.  I also have some information at 
.

You should probably know how to do this before you consider moving to a mixed 
system.  There's (aptitude -t testing hpijs-ppds) and (aptitude hpijs-
ppds/testing) which seem fairly similar but can do very different things.
