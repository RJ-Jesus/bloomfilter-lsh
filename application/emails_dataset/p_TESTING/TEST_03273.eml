What I mean is that we don't show up right in that quickie list of results
immediately below the search box.
All of apple's products do.  And if you search for consultant, the apple
consultants info shows.
But type in user group variations and nothing shows.
Many users don't know that there is anything but that tiny box.  Yes it says
"search all of apple" with an arrow button
But believe me people are stupid and if it doesn't show in that little list,
they won't pursue much further
And why don't the user groups deserve to be in the highlighted list of
results to begin with?  I say they do.
