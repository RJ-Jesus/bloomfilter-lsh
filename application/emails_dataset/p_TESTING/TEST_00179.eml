SUBJECT: how to control tty to external monitor or local lcd

Hi
I have a hp mini, which has a 0:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel
Corporation Mobile 945GME Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
I would like to know how I can force ttyX to go to the external monitor and
then back to the local lcd.
Also have a problem that if I have my X going to an external monitor and
then suspend and re awaken with the laptop not connected to an external
monitor I can't get my X session back I have to restart gdm.
