How about this instead of the last paragraph:
---
Please note that the Security Team does not monitor unstable. It is up 
to the individual maintainer to fix the issue. This may under 
circumstances take longer, e.g. if the maintainer is waiting for a new 
version from upstream. There are also no Debian Security Advisories 
(DSA) for issues that are present in the unstable version of a software, 
but not the versions in stable and/or testing.

Aoki-san, what do you think, is this getting too long? I also thought 
about mentioning alternate sources to get security informations (CVEs 
and such).
Regards,
Andrei
