Nope.  That's for doing it yourself.
There's a lot of backports already maintained by existing DDs and DMs.  Check 
out .  Just add one 
line to your sources.list and then (aptitude install hplip/lenny-backports) 
should do it.
It's currently an unofficial service, but I think Debian wants to do something 
like it as an official service during the lifetime of Squeeze or Squeeze+1 and 
future releases.
