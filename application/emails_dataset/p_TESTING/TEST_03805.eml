Eric Eldred _himself_ was just on Marketplace[1]. 
NYTimes: Debate to Intensify on Copyright Extension Law[2] (front page of the 
business section, below the fold). " It will fall to Mr. Lessig, who is a 
former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and who has become a kind 
of rock star for the digital liberties set, to convince the justices to accept 
the unconventional analysis. If they do, the decision could be a turning point 
in redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers â and the 
technology companies that are often in the middle." 
Newsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. "Larry Lessig admits it: heâs nervous. Who 
wouldnât be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the 
seemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. 
But itâs actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in 
the age of the Internet." 'Thereâs a sense of deja vu to this. Television was 
supposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industryâs 
silver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that âthe VCR is to the American 
film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman 
home alone.â (Video sales are now the studiosâ biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, 
Hollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than âNightmare on Elm 
Street.â'
