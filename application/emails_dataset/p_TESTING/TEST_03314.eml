SUBJECT: Re: NewMovieFromDataRef crashes when QT movie URL is not found

I don't think it is the problem with valid graphics port (I have tried
by creating a NewGWorld and setting that as the current port too).
If the movie is present at the specified URL the call succeeds and I
could play the movie. It is crashing only if the movie is not found at
the URL.
