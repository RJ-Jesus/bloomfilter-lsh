.1. Sponsorship, How and Why? Veuve Clicquot Speaks 
    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10, 
2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex, 
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy. 
 
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the 
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the 
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer - 
known locally as The English Season. 
Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our 
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these 
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport. 
  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication 
tool?
Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the 
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where 
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We 
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time. 
  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?
We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of 
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and 
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and 
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to 
make The Season central to our marketing mix. 
  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?
We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our 
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the 
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and 
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever 
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.
We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions 
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office will 
like to be involved in such a decision. 
  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?
Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment 
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events. 
This is our rule and frame of investment.
  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?
Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-Ã -
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press, 
magazine of all kinds). 
Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that 
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of 
similar status, but differing interests. 
  Please describe one of your sponsorships
The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdray 
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by 
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve 
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target 
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the 
king of sports.
  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?
Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large 
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we 
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve 
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are 
getting a good return on our investment.
  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?
