So what? People moved on. You can do the same if current situation does not 
suite you OR you can actually do something real to improve situation. Ranting 
isn't among that "something".

Seriously, attacks on personal preferences is the best you can do? To be 
honest, it's none of your business what everybody else is using and why. 
Personal preferences are highly subjective and they say really nothing about 
quality of other similar software in the market. By your logic, you should be 
using Windows because apparently it is the best OS in the world due to 
enormous PC market penetration (over 90%).

I tried to find a logic in this reasoning but utterly failed. If you are going 
to respect Ana's work less just because she is using mutt, I believe we have 
nothing to talk about.

Maybe. Yet what did you do to improve the situation? And maybe it was not just 
KDE SC 4 fault, was it?
