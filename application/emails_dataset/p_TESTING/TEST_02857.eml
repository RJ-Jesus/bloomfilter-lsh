Let me first welcome all the new people to the Sporadic -- there were a bunch of people who signed up a while ago but never got added until today, I think the problems have been fixed.  There are currently over 250,000 subscribers to this 
list (dayam!).  Of those, I think there are around 5 people who actually read it.
So anyway, raise your hand if you're older than 30 and have never been married.  
Unless I meet the girl of my dreams tomorrow (which is unlikely as I don't plan on leaving my apartment tomorrow, much less wearing pants anytime in the near future), looks like I'm headed in that direction.
I never think about it but it seems I'm supposed to.  I definitely don't want to be one of those guys who's a bachelor for life, and I eventually want kids, I think that's cool!  But today, October 30, 2002, is my 27th birthday.
To celebrate, I bought myself some Rogain, tooth whitener, and a gym membership.  My detergent makes the skin on my back hurt and I still have zits.  Oh hey I bought a new guitar and played dress up, that was fun.
It's 4:00 AM and I'm eating expired ham.  Somehow I'm able to write a newsletter to 250,000 people, yet my birthday plans involve sitting home alone teaching myself Journey songs on the guitar.  then Blockbuster and Chinese delivery.  
Woohoo!  
Anyway, thanks for being there. 
Rock on,
pud

dishonest, but he behaves completely inappropriately with female associates working under him".. and so on.

Okee I reported yesterday that CDNow was set to layoff 60 people... well rumor has it the 
axe just fell and the *entire* programming staff was let go.  Whether this means the company is shutting down or they're just being replaced by cheaper consultants remains to be seen...
