So have I.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise.  I looked at them for deciding 
on reiserfs, then I replicated the results on my own hardware using bonnie++ 
before restoring my backups.
I also look around for results about once a year, to see if much has changed, 
or if there are new file systems I should look at.  Less often, I'll try and 
run my own bonnie++ tests, but not rigorously; they occur on my system under 
whatever load I happen to be running.

Trust, but verify.
The note was only indicative that I wasn't didn't have data or analysis in 
front of me, so I was running off of memory.  Usually, that's fine, but I was 
talking about specific file system implementation features in multiple file 
systems.  Since I don't implement or debug file systems every day, I thought 
an idle warning was in order.

That's not a theory; or that least it is not hypothetical.  It's proven true 
over and over, and software ranging from OSes to libraries to RDBMSes to 
desktop applications.

Took me a little while, but I see bug-fix patches from this year.  It's not be 
abandoned quite as quickly as I was lead to believe.  I still don't recommend 
it for new installs, but there's a-priori reason to migrate away from it right 
now.

These have significant overhead over file system-specific methods.  They are 
the both universal and fairly conservative, so your advocacy is well-
justified.  It's also pretty easy to do them wrong, or get a poorly performing 
file system out of them.  It's easy to forget extended attributes and  ACLs  
when using cp/tar/rsync; there may be other file system data that needs to be 
preserved, too (HPFS+ forks?).  Taking a kernel tarball from a ext3 file 
system and extracting it on a reiserfs file system takes much longer than 
taking a kernel tarball from a reiserfs file system and extracting to on a 
reiserfs file system.
