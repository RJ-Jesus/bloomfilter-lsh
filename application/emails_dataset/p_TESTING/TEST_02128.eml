Restoring those files would not actually cause a downgrade to occur.  They 
would just cause the state of the package manager to not accurately reflect 
the state of the system. -- Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by "apt

If you need an old package, snapshot.debian.org should have it.  You can then 
you pinning to avoid upgrading it -- either to a specific version or at all.
