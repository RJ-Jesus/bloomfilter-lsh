Does it annoy anyone else that the 'aptitude' package no longer provides an 
'aptitude' binary?
Typing 'aptitude-curses' is a little annoying.  I'm assuming the rename is 
because of work on aptitude-gtk and aptitude-qt.  If so, wouldn't using the 
alternatives system for an 'aptitude' symlink make sense?
