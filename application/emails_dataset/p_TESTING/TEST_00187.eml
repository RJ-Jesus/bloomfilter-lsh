PoE Scenario 1: IP Phone 
Â 
Network Design NoticeIP Phone deployment is a typical example for half-PoE application.Power Consumption Estimation: The IP Phone is a low-power device which does not consume too much currency. Normally, its power consumption is less than 7.5W, so, the half-PoE is good for the IP Phone deployment, and it saves money for customers. Cost-saving: Furthermore, the PoE technology saves the power adapter for each IP Phone, saves the power socket space, and reduces the wiring complexity, makes the desktop more clean and tidy. 
Â 
Bandwidth Calculation: By using the Z3526C2PL24W(24-Port FE with Half-PoE + 2GbE Uplink) as the PoE switch to connect the IP Phones, the bandwidth is big enough for each voice link, and the uplink is fast enough even all IP phones are in use. Management Features: In the web-based management features of the PoE switch, you can easily find a function to enable/disable each port. It makes the administrator easier to control each phone. He/she can even use the Remote Power Control feature of the PoE switch to control the power ON/OFF physically to each IP Phone.
Â 
Network Scalability: The IP Phones connect to PoE switches, and the PoE switches, in turn, connect to the central Gigabit switchdes, and then to the ISP. By using the 2-layer connection scheme, we can deploy hundreds or thousands of IP Phones. The structure is very scalable. Besides, The phone management can be converged to the same network management systems.
Â 
Â 
Â 
PoE Scenario 2: IP CAM & Wireless AP 
Â 
Network Design NoticeIn hotels, dormitories or institutional buildings, there are some embeded service devices (such as wireless AP), security devices (such as IP Camera) or some IP devices of the Building Management System(for entrance control or fingerprint recognition). Network & Power Cabling Convergence: All of the devices and systems are gradually convergent into the IP infrastructure. These heterogeneous devices will benefit from connecting to the PoE switches. Both the IP traffic and the electric power are distributed by the same cabling systems. 
Â 
Cost-saving in lifecycle: It saves the set-up and installation costs, as well as the troubleshooting, maintenance, backup, and management-staff cost. It will be a great saving.No more power line wiring everywhere !Network Design: Should we connect different devices to different PoE switches or should we connect them to share the same PoE switch? It depends. If the network traffic for some devices is very critical, then we may suggest to use dedicated PoE switches for the critical devices.
Â 
Distance coverage consideration: The PoE switch can support the PoE devices within 100-meter radius. For large building or multi-building deployment, we should group the PoE devices into several areas, connecting the devices in the same area to the same PoE switch, and then connecting the PoE switches to the central switch.In some cases, the PoE switch will be in a few locations, far away from the central switch. The Z3624FL2P is a 24-port SFP & UTP Combo switch, with Layer 2+ management feature. By using the fiber switch as the central switch, we can easily connect all the PoE switches together.
Â 
Â 
Â 
PoE Scenario 3: High-Wattage Devices 
Â 
New Standard: PoE+For some high power-consumption PoE devices, such as SpeedDome, a new standard, 802.3at (also known as PoE+), is finalized to provide more power to drive the devices.It may takes a while to get more popular about this standard because the PoE devices have to be redesigned to adapt to the new standard. 
Before configuring the PoE installation, you are suggested to check the electrical specification carefully, such as the volage, the currency, the power consumption, the pin-assignment, etc, to avoid any mismatch. 
ZyGMA7 provides 8 PoE+ switch models for the PoE+ market. Please refer to the details....Contact for Product & PricingIf you are interested in getting the Product & Pricing information about PoE, please contact with ZyGMA7

SFP Price List (Click to Enlarge) 
We provide SFPDirectâ¢ service, Help to save 15% to 25% buying cost for you !SFP is a contiously-evolving device. But now is a critical moment for its growth. All of us have no way to be out of it. It become more and more important !!SFP is gaining positions: SFP is on the way to replace the media converters. Meanwhile, SFP is on the way to have more standardized form-factor than ever. For example, SFP+ consumes less power (i.e. it generates less heat) than XFP, XENPAK and X2, having the same physical form factor as SFP, but running as fast as 10G speed. The SFP has better compliance or compatibility (eg. MSA, Multi-Source Agreement). The SFP has better-than-ever diagnostics features (eg. DDMI, Digital Diagnostics Monitoring Interface). As a result, the SFP is getting more and more popular, in all market segments, including the telecom, the Fibre Channel storage, and the Ethernet networking markets.ZyGMA7 provides a broad range of SFP products, conntecting to Multi-mode-fiber or Single-mode-fiber, with different distance range, Bi-Di type, CWDM type, Cisco compatible, MSA compliance, 10Gbps XFP or SFP+, Gigabit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Fiber Channel, in Commercial-grade or Industrial-grade, etc. (see SFP Product Overview)
The SFPDirectâ¢ service will save your buying cost 15% to 25%, depending on items.

A Nice Feature for PoE Remote Power Control
From the web management screen, users can control the ON/OFF of each port remotely. It is a great advantage than the non-PoE powering system to the remote devices. The flexibility is very useful when the remote devices need to be rebooted. By connecting the switch to the internet, administrators can even control the power remotely from the internet.PoE Technology Dictionary802.3af: PoE standard, finalized at June 12, 2003, providing up to 15.4W DC power in which 12.95W is assured to be available to the Powered Device other than the power dissipated in the cable.802.3at: PoE+ standard, finalized at Sep 11, 2009, providing up to 25.5W power.ZyGMA7 PoE Strategy: Focus & Differentiation
PoE Switch is a different market segment other than the network switch because:The cost of Power Supply is higher than the cost of Switch, it makes the PoE distribution channel behaves differently than the network switch channel. The PoE market is highly related to the project application. It indeed saves cost to the integrators or customers. But the customer application stratifies the PoE products to many sub-segments, it in turn makes the distribution channel behaves differently.ZyGMA7 is endeavoured to develop the PoE products with differentiations, providing our business partners what they need in their specific application domain.
