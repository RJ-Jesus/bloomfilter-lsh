Wow, I just have read the complete thread and it's looks promising.
Your post (and Wikipedia article :-P) have motivated me enough to give 
DVD-RAM a try along with UDF (or maybe FAT32) filesystem. I didn't like 
so much all that DVDÂ±RW stuff and the problems that may arise while using 
a different UDF spec but after reading this I'm gonna give it a chance.
Thanks for sharing this :-)
