I have exactly the same problem on a 600X ThinkPad, using an IBM High
Rate Wireless LAN PC Card, but not on a T42pThinkPad, both running up
to date sid. 
I have no clue what causes the problem, but I have found a clumsy
workaround by trial and error: when I reset the router (Linksys
WRT54GL) either to WPA from WPA2, or back the other way, wic manages
to connect the next try. It doesn't seem to matter whether wic is
looking for a password or a pre-shared key, so long as the the
protocol is TKIP.  Next time, I have to reset the router back the
other way. No further change required -- until the next time, when the
router needs to be reset _again_!.
It's a nuisance and a puzzlement. The only clue I get from
/var/log/daemon.log is
dhclient: send_packet: Network is unreachable
dhclient: send_packet: please consult README file regarding broadcast address
(I find nothing helpful in any README (in /usr/share/doc/dhcp-client or
dhcp-common.)
After that, ifplugd finds the network, and dhclient fails to secure a
connection. Until I reset the router and try again.
Good luck figuring out a better solution.
