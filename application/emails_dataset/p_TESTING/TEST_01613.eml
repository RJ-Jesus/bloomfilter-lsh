SUBJECT: Lost the auto-upgrade applet

Hi,
When I first installed debian, I got an auto-updater that would periodically
offer me the chance to upgrade based on what was out of date. This has
stopped appearing now, how do I get it back? I'm using Gnome and it appeared
in the notification window by the clock.
Thanks!
Jim
