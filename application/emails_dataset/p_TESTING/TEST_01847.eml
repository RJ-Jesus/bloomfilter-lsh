SUBJECT: Re: About apt, kernel updates and dist-upgrade

About apt.conf there are these lines:
----
RPM 
{
   // Leave list empty to disable
   AllowedDupPkgs {"^kernel$"; "kernel-smp"; "kernel-enterprise"; };
   HoldPkgs {"kernel-source"; "kernel-headers"; };
}
----
How do I tell apt hold all kernel packages? Can I use syntax like 
"kernel*"; ? 
And I don't quite understand what the part "^kernel$"; means?
