SUBJECT: kde4: crash after login

Hi,
 I am using Debian Sid. After doing the login (by using either KDM or GDM) KDE seems to crash, and the only thing I can see is the mouse pointer over a black screen.
 I have looked for some information in the logs but I have not found anything significant. In the syslog is written down the following line but I am not sure whether this is important:
"Cannot load /usr/share/apps/kdm/faces/.default.face: No such file or directory"
 What can I do to find out what is happening? (this is frustrating)
 Regards,
