SUBJECT: Any file details on an executable binary file?

Hello list,
I was wondering if anyone could suggest a package or means to look at any or all of the information from a given executable binary file:
- What compiler compiled it
- What (source) language was it compiled from
- What computer architecture the file was compiled for
- How many hardware bits was the file intended for (eg. 32-bit or 64-bit encoding)
- Endianness
If any of the above a simply not possible because of the nature all binary files, it would be helpful to know that too.
Thanks.
 
-M
