I used Etch on my desktop and Laptop for quite a while with little to no loss 
of functionality.  I don't really understand why you think you need the latest 
release.  I want well-tested software so I can use it instead of fix it or 
wait until it gets fixed.  I also want stable software so I'm not having to 
relearn a UI every week or so.
Now, I currently run a mixed system on both my desktop and laptop.  It 
includes packages from Lenny, testing, and Sid.  I originally did this to be 
able to use KDE SC 4.2.  I am hoping that I can switch back to using stable 
Debian for both the desktop and laptop once Squeeze is released.
I also use Debian on a number of servers.  I enable a mixed system there as 
well, but I have yet to need to pull any packages from testing or Sid.
