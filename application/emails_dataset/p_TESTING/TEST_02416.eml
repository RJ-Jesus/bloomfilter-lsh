SUBJECT: JPEG vs MotionJPEG

Hi all,
May be a very basic question to ask.
Can anyone tell me the advantages of using MotionJPEG over JPEG in a
video file? 
Because I have JPEG frames, so would it be restructered to support
MotionJPEG   
If MotionJPEG is advantageous is there exists a ISO standard for that?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Kaushik
