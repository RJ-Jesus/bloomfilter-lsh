SUBJECT: Lenny - GNOME FTP Connect To Server

Dear All,
I mounted an FTP site using GNOME Connect To Server.
But I cannot PUT any files over FTP to host.
It says: Error "Bad File Handle" while copying.
However I can GET files over FTP from host alright.
On Etch it works both ways, GET and PUT, only on Lenny I have got these
errors.
Would anyone see why?
Many thanks.
