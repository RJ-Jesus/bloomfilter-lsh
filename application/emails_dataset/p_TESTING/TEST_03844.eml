IMHO when a config setting is not handled properly on upgrade of KDE its a 
bug.
I migrated configuration from KDE 3.5.10 and just pressed on "Reset to 
defaults" for quite some appearance related settings in order to switch 
them to Oxygen. There have been issues, but I mostly didn't file them as 
bugs.
Only one I triaged and filed: The separator "58" for colon for web 
shortcuts in kuriikwsrc or something like that it was is not recognized by 
KRunner, only by Konqueror. ":" instead works with both. Unfortunately 
Konqueror saved it as "58" not as ":".
Anyway I suggest to file those issues as concrete as possible as bugs as 
you manage to take time for it.
