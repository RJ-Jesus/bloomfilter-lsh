I have already forwarded them to the list and would gladly send them on to you 
if you were to ask me to do so.  But list policy is to stay on list unless 
requested to do otherwise. ;-)
The last one in particular was personal, rude and unpleasant.  He is not

He is doing that, but in addition he is bullying people most unpleasantly if 
they do not do his bidding.  I do not use KDE 4 and have no wish to do so. 
The only thing I could have done differently (other than not send that very 
short and mild complaint) is bow down to Dotan and agree that I have no right 
to dislike KDE 4, because he does not find my reasons valid.  I tried to end 
this by simply not replying, but even that did not rescue me - he sent 
another email, to which I again did not reply.  What more could I do, other 
than be very rude myself, to make him go away?
I do not have to give him reasons for my dislike.  I dislike KDE 4 and do not 
use it.  That is surely my right?  I dislike fennel.  No-one tries to 
force-feed me with it!
And surely I have no duty to help Dotan in his single minded ambition to 
impose KDE 4 on all the world?  Many of us do not use it.  Several people 
have been very helpful in sending me comments (_on_ list) on other 
possibilities.  
If he is truly doing what he is doing from altruistic motives, then surely he 
must only "help" (help????) those who want his help, not bully those who 
don't.
