Well, I did omit those two reasons, but I didn't forget about them: it is that 
I don't consider them reasons to run Sid, much less to counsel anyone else to 
do it.  Neither new hardware nor new software are reasons (on my own regard, 
of course) to run a whole in-development OS (which is what Sid is).
You stay with known-to-work hardware and software on production environments 
to start with (non-production environments can, of course, qualify on both 
the "peeking into the future" and "for fun" clauses).  If you can't stay on 
the known path, then you backport what you need; this way at least you'll 
have a clear notice about where your (future) problems are coming from.
And then, if once everything considered it really becomes attractive to go for 
a future, in-development version (basically, too much of a burden on the 
backporting effort), you still have a case for Testing, not Sid (I for one 
I'm open to consider Testing as an alternative on my workplace... for new 
projects that can provide strong reasons to do it and once Testing 
is "frozen" so probably it will already be Stable by the time the project 
goes "live").
Cheers.
