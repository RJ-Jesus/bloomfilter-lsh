Like others have said, this is a device naming issue. In order to boot 
you must fix your fstab, preferably to use something else than device 
names. Labels are easier to set up by hand IMO.
After that you have to make sure the 'root=' parameter in grub is 
correct. The easiest way is to 'e' (edit) the respective line at the 
grub boot menu and experiment until you find the correct device name.

I think that is deprecated since a long time (probably since udev is 
around).

A new kernel could help only if it assigns the same device names as you 
have in menu.lst/fstab, but I think it's the bad approach.
