I guess it was not very obvious from my first message. My goal is to fix 
this issue for Squeeze, not for me, but for other users potentially 
affected by this bug. It won't affect me as I only use unstable on this 
machine. But in order to help fix it I need to:
1. backport the patch for 2.6.32
2. recompile a standard Debian kernel with the patch included (for 
testing purposes)
3. report a bug with the backported patch included asking for inclusion 
in the default squeeze kernel
Unfortunately I lack the skills for 1. and I was asking for comments on 
whether it is too complicated to pursue:
- if it's trivial I could just go to 3., offer my help for 2. and hope 
  the kernel team has enough time to do 1.
- if it's doable I could ask on alsa-user or alsa-devel, hoping to find 
  a kind soul to help
- if it's too complicated I can just drop it since the issue would be 
  solvable in squeeze by installing a newer kernel from backports (not 
  ideal)
Hope this explains,
Andrei
