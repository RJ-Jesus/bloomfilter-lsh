Subject: dumb question: X client behind a firewall?
Let's say you're behind a firewall and have a NAT address.
Is there any way to telnet to a linux box out there in the world
and set your DISPLAY in some way that you can create
xterms on your own screen?

I'm in no way a pro but perhaps you could set your Firewall to accept connections from that Linux box and then somehow set the Linux box to transmit on a specific port. Then configure your router to forward all information from that port to your box.
But then again, that pretty much defeats the entire point of a firewall =P.Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn.com
