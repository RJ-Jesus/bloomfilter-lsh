Usually security fixes are uploaded "priority=high", which means faster 
migration (3 days?). Sid is still ahead, but not by 10 days.

During this cycle the security support is not there (yet). Might happen 
during the freeze. But also the maintainer might take the *stable* patch 
and adapt it for the package in sid ;)

Makes sense. And if you care about security do subscribe to 
debian-security-announce and debian-testing-security-announce. You don't 
need the later if you run pure stable, but makes sense in any other mix 
(including backports). The traffic of both lists combined is about one 
message per day.

I install stable as much as I can due to:
- security support
- low maintenance overhead
Once installed just watch debian-security-announce (and debian-announce 
for point releases if you don't use proposed-updates) and 
update/safe-upgrade as needed.

I installed testing for people who thought Debian is just too old 
(usually with KDE 4, which makes a good impression to Windows users).  
Unless the user already has some Debian experience it's a must have that 
I can somehow regularly access the system (usually ssh).

I would get terribly bored if I was to run anything else but sid on my 
own laptop. The only other machine at home is now pure stable, but mpd 
won't play my favorite stream (aac unfortunately).
