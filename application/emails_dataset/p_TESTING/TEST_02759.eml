Again. AFAIK KMail doesn't use Akonadi at all. Its the new KAddressBook 
that based on Akonadi. And since KMail uses it for address completion...
For the user it looks as if KMail uses Akonadi, but to the best of my 
knowledge it doesn't - at least not directly. Otherwise there wouldn't be 
much point in the akonadi- / nepomuk-based rewrite of KMail as KMail 2.

And I want to add: It does not render it unusable for everyone.
Even when Akonadi does not start up cleanly, which happens on first start 
of Kontact for example as I reported already, I still *can* use KMail. Its 
just that the address book function do not work properly then. Although I 
didn't even verify this. Cause even when I get the Akonadi startup errors, 
KAddressBook shows the list of the people in my address book, its just 
ghosted out and not clickable. So maybe address completion would still 
work. But even if it doesn't, KMail as a whole actually does still work 
then.
Anyway, most important is to file and an all bugs with Akonadi in KDEPIM 
upstream ASAP. And that is where I suggest that people - including you 
Boyd - put their energy now.
