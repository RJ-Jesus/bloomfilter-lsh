SUBJECT: [ILUG] serial console question

I've found a decrepit raq3 that I'm going to resurrect, as soon as I work
out what's up with the console.
 I'm using 115200 8n1 with minicom, and I'm getting wierd stuff like:
S+#_+ÃÂ± INET __+_: 
S+#_+ÃÂ± ÃÂ°_Â°_ MÃ+Ã+ÃÂ± _+Ã+ Â°+_<_++_.
S+#_+ÃÂ± #+__+ S+#_+ÃÂ± #+Ã + __+_:

S+#_+ÃÂ± ++Ã S++ÃÂ± +Ã W S_+: 
 So it looks like some sort of setting mismatch. Various places on the web
say that cobalts are setup with 115200 8n1 serial ports, but someone could
have changed it on this particular box.
 Anyone care to guess what's up ?
