SUBJECT: Is it safe to update-rc.d remove defaults ntp with dependency boot
 in place?

As some of you might know, the transition to dependency based
boot / insserv is causing the following lines:
Â Â Â  insserv: warning: current stop runlevel(s) (0 1 6) of script `ntp'
Â  Â  overwrites defaults (empty).
Â  Is it safe for the system administrator to issue
Â Â Â  update-rc.d remove defaults ntp
Â Â Â  update-rc.d remove start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 . ntp
?  That is, will such commands break something?
Â  Some references are bugs 568974 and 183460.
