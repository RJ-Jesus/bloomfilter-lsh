IMHO, I doubt it would help. There will always be cases where it is very 
difficult to draw the line between Depends: vs Recommends: (see the not 
very long ago flames about making xorg depend on hal) and also 
Recommends: vs Suggests:
An interesting proposal a while ago was to be able to add some more 
information to Suggests:, something like:
Package: acpi-support
Suggests: radeontool (backlight control for ATI Radeon based laptops)

Andrei
