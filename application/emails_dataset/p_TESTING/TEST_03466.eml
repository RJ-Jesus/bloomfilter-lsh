Dear Dr. Ban,
It is my pleasure to inform you about the latest developments to The Computer 
Journal 
(http://sci.scientific-direct.net/c.asp?814748&41248fb1d7ff79fc&11), 
which has enjoyed a doubling in submissions since I started as Editor-in-Chief in 2008.
New Sections
In recent years, the journal has seen major growth in its readership and Impact Factor as 
a result of our choice to expand the scope and renew its editorial board. As a first step, 
the journal divided into two sections in 2009: 
- Section A - Computer Science, Methods and Tools
- Section B - Networks and Computer Systems.
The massive growth in submissions allowed us first to go from 6 to 8 issues in 2009, 
and now allows us to increase the journal's size once again in 2010 from 8 to 10 
issues per year while also strengthening its high selectivity, and to add a new section: 
- Section C: Computational Intelligence.
New Look
The Computer Journal will also have a new look which goes in line with the 
re-branding of the British Computer Society. The re-designed cover shown 
above will be implemented from 2010.
International Editorial Board
The Editorial Board has been renewed and enlarged to include new members 
from Europe, Asia and North America. This reflects the journal's status as a truly 
international enterprise - with over 90% of submissions and institutional subscriptions 
now coming from outside the UK.
Computer science is constantly evolving and The Computer Journal
will reflect this by continuing to explore new opportunities as they arise. For more 
information on the current developments please read my Editorial FREE online at

Your sincerely,
Erol Gelenbe
Editor-in-Chief
