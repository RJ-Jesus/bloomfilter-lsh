I don't find that "joke" funny.  It's not offensive or anything, just the 
context is all messed up.

I prefer Debian because more packages are well-maintained under main.  Ubuntu 
provides good support for universe, I guess.  But, the fact that Ubuntu feels 
those packages need to be separated just demonstrates that they are "second-
class".
Ubuntu LTS is my second choice, and something I recommend if it is likely that 
the user wants a commercial support contract.  I find the package manager that 
Ubuntu shares with Debian to be enough of an advantage to put it above other 
solutions like RHEL or SLE(D/S).
I am comfortable enough to use and maintain RHEL and SLE(S/D) in fairly simple 
environments, if the user has some specific need for one of those systems.  
That's rare, but is often related to third-party hardware or software being 
certified with one of those.
