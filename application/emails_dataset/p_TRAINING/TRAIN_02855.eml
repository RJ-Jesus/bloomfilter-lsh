I have real issues with having to spare the disk space and RAM on my laptop 
for it.  PostgreSQL is for work; I don't get much choice about running that.
I also have a history with MySQL and I *do* *not* *trust* it with my data.  
UPS or not.  My email is fairly important for me -- I am probably in KMail 
only slightly less than I am in a source code editor.  When I'm testing or 
deploying updates, I spend *more* time in KMail.
Yes.  I agree.  The kmail -> mysql-server dependency is not actually an "RC" 
bug, for Debian.
It is for me, but I run an exotic mixed system anyway, so I'll figure 
*something* out.
