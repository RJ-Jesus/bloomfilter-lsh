If there's such a mass of users wanting to keep kde3 going, it is 
theoretically possible to collectively fund a developper to do the work you 
want done. 
quanta and freenet are 2 examples of programs for whom such a thing has been 
done
That ofc assumes that:
a) theres's a sufficient mass of users that want to keep kd3 going in at 
least maintenance mode
b) they care enough to chip in a little bit
