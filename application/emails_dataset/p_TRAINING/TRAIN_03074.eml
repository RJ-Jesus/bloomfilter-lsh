SUBJECT: Copy/Paste .ps/.pdf often gives a `snippets' icon

Hi,
When copying and pasting a .ps or a .pdf file, or a serie of such files,
the resulting (i.e. pasted) files' icon is often the `snippets' one,
i.e. the one which designates a broken/corrupted file. However, when
right-clicking on the files, their content appears as the icon, i.e. the
`snippets' icon disappears. Why? Is it normal? I do not like copying and
pasting files and seeing such an icon, because one might think that
these are corrupted files.
Thanks.
