Note that mysql recently split their server package into a "server" and a 
"core" package, so you get a minimal mysql installation without a system-
wide copy of mysql running.
Yes, akonadi will still use mysql internally, but it's (mostly) transparent 
to the user.  My main issue with the akonadi/mysql dependencies is thus 
solved.
(Yes, it is not very cool to have mysql running for akonadi and virtuoso for 
nepomuk/strigi and probably quite a few copies of libsqlite and libdb for 
other subsystems.  But I guess we'll just have to live with that unless 
we're prepared to do the work ourselves... )
