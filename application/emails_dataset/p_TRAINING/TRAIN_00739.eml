I second Ron's point.  If you are trying for certification to "obtain
the knowledge" you'd be better off IMHO to spend the time on the
system or with other sys admins.  Certification usually is nothing
but a "stripe" on your resume and is not necessarily indicative of
your knowledge-it may help in a job search, however.
