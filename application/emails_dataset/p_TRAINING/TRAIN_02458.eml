Have you tried creating a new account and looking if it's there as well?  
The menu is basically system wide, but users may customize it (and I 
absolutely don't understand how system wide and local menu are merged.)
If it's not system wide, removing the right files from your ~/.kde, ~/.local 
and/or ~/.config directories should probably cure the proble,  (If you 
didn't do much customizing you can obviously nuke your whole configuration 
but in my case, that would lose quite a few hours configuration work, not to 
speak of stuff like address book/calendar data etc. ...)
