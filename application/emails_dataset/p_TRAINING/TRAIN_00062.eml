KMail doesn't use Akonadi at all in KDE 4.4. It might use Akonadi in KDE 
4.5. The only thing using Akonadi by default in KDE 4.4 is the new 
KAddressBook. AFAIK.
So KDE 4.5 might even be more problematic in the beginning. Especially 
when I remember the roughnesses of KDE 4.3.0 and KDE 4.4.0 I do not 
suggest to ship a .0 or even .1 release of KDE. Even KDE 4.4.2 had quite 
some bugs that KDE 4.4.3 fixed.
So shipping KDE 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 oder 4.4.5 IMHO could well be a better 
option that to ship KDE 4.5.0 with Debian Squeeze.
Sadly I have not seen any KDE 4.x.0 release yet thats really suitable for 
Debian Stable.
Ciao,
