SUBJECT: KWebkitPart dependency

Heyho!
Short note to the KDE packagers since kdenetwork now depends on 
libkwebkitpart-dev: don't hesitate to NMU (even with zero delay) if it helps 
to get KDE into squeeze faster.  (In any case, and if no bug reports come 
in, I'll just wait with the next upload until kwebkitpart is in testing.)
cheers
