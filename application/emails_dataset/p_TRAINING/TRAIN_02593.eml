I would be.  And do we not mean Squeeze?  Lenny has KDE 3.5.10.

I have looked at all those, in addition to KDE 4 and Gnome.  None appeals to 
me.  Each has something that I strongly dislike or does not have something 
that I like and use a lot.  I would love to be able to upgrade to Squeeze if 
new(er) hardware dictates, but keep KDE 3.5.  But I am not even almost 
tempted to go over to the dark side!
I am, however, very sad that KDE 3.5, which I regard as the pinnacle of DE's, 
is being laid to rest.
