That is troublesome, probably to the point of actually being broken.  It's 
likely that something "behind-the-scenes" in LVM is actually messing with the 
snapshot device even when it is not mounted and preventing the removal.
I'm fairly sure the snapshot device has to be updated whenever a write is done 
to a new LE in the original device, and it's possible *that* is causing the 
problem.  I hope this issue gets some attention; I doubt it is a Debian-ism.

My guess on this one is one of two things:
1) Udev is taking a little while to unlink "secondary" names for the LVs that 
are being removed, and when lvm does its device scan it's hitting "missing" 
devices.
2) LVM is using device names from its cache for devices that are no longer 
present for its device scan and, again, hitting "missing" devices.
In either case I think the error messages are annoying, but not indicative of 
a real problem.
