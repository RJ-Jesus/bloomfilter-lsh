SUBJECT: Re: Lite SMTP server/daemon

Hi Celejar,
Thank you for your reply.
I use Linux running inÂ  Compact Flash so that the size of the Compact flash memory is the 
limit
Users willÂ  send emails to a program running in the Compact flash so I need a mail server 
there too.
Only SMTP, no POP3 server
Can you suggest something?
Thank you .
Best regards,
Lad.
