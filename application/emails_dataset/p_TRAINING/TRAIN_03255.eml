Just for the record, I am experiencing similar problems: X (or KDE) becoming 
almost unusably slow. FWIW, I have a Lenovo Z61m with a Radeon Mobility X1400 
chipset.
When I'm just working on the notebook display, everything is fine usually, but 
when I connect a separate display, performance decreases a lot.
Suspend works fine for me, though. With 4.4.2, I even get a nice notification 
that the display settings have changed afer having plugged the notebook in the 
docking station and waking up from suspend.

Have you tried not using desktop effects? Does that make a difference?
