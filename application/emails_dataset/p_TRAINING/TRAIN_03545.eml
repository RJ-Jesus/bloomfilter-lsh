I think that perhaps there is some language barrier.
Your original post indicates that you want lines 1, 2, 4 and no others output.  
"i want only output the first, second, and fourth line"
Your most recent post says that is "the problem".  Which I infer means 
something you don't want.
Could you maybe rephrase the question, or at least be a bit more verbose?
...
If you want the output to go to a file try something like (sed -ne '1,2p;4p' 
"$input" > "$output").
