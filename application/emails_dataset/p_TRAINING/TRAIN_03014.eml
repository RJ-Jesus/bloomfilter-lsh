SUBJECT: How to manage multiple Internet connections?

Hi,
Let's say that you have two internet connections at home, and
consequently two devices which link your computer to the Internet. How
can you manage, e.g. in Iceweasel/FF, to use one or the other? If you
have multiple downloads all the time, it might be an interesting thing
to split them among the diferent connections.
