Well, I maintain about 4 Debian servers... and I've been using Debian 
almost exclusively ever since the .deb packaging system got rolled out 
(yeah... waaaayyy back). Because Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian (in 
the sense that just about anything available for Debian is either also 
packaged for, or the Debian package is installable on, Ubuntu), and also 
because we in the Debian crowd have better kung-fu than those lame 
GUI-installer Ubuntu-ites...... *and* because I've already been 
subscribed on this list for several years....   I figured I'd ask here.

Yeah, I saw IBAM, but it looked like it just generated plain ol' .png 
files or something. I was hoping for something a little more snazzy.
