Some are included in the tarball provided by the Linux kernel team, which is 
distributed under the GPLv2.  In particular, I am thinking of the iwl3945 
firmware that is required to run my wireless card.
It doesn't matter what upstream wants to call source code.  The GPL(v2) 
defines it as the preferred form for making modifications.  (GPLv2, section 
3.)  It is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor (or 
equivalent).  Most likely it is C source for a freestanding (non-hosted) 
environment with some manufacturer-specific libraries, but it could also be in 
some manufacturer-specific assembly code.  Either form would be better for 
making modifications than a binary blob.
