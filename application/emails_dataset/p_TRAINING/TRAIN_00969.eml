The activities system upto to KDE 4.4 IMHO is quite broken. Activity 
selection is slow, it forgets which activity is mapped to which desktop 
from time to time and and and... I reported about 10 bugs just regarding 
that activity system in KDE's bugtracker, of which a user named Beat Wolf 
marked most invalid in the last days cause this stuff gets completely 
rewritten in KDE 4.5. In KDE 4.5 there will be a new activity system 
sporting Nepomuk and whatnot, I think there has been a blog post, maybe by 
Aaron Seigo on Planet KDE.I agree rewriting the stuff is one of the better 
things you can do with it ;-).  Let's see what comes out of it.
