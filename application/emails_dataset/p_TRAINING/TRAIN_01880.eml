According to http://packages.debian.org/chromium-browser [1] it is only 
available in sid/unstable. backports.org usually carries newer versions 
of packages compiled for stable, but the policy is to have only packages 
from testing.
[1] I could have told you the same with
'apt-cache policy chromium-browser', but I do have sources for all three 
releases ;)
You could also try to backport it yourself or just compile from source.  
The upstream provided debs I don't like, because of the way they handle 
updates.

Andrei
