SUBJECT: debian installer ISO: customizing with new packages

Hi,
 I would like to add two packages to the netiso installer. I have found this link, but I think I need more detailed instructions:
http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Modify/CD
 Do you know a web resource that describes the necessary steps to create a new debian installer ISO including new packages?
 Regards,
