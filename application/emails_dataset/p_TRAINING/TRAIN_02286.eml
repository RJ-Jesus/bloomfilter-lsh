Debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software, good integration 
of it throughout the whole distribution and general assumption that it won't 
eat their kittens (yet data loss bugs happen). But whether upstream software 
meets users' needs is out of Debian scope. Just find another software/solution 
which does, develop it by yourself, pay somebody to develop it for you or ask 
kindly and wait till somebody else is motivated enough to do it.

Move on. kdepim 4.3 is gone. Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepim 
from 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating dead 
horse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. I recommend you to face reality here.

Don't you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales? 
YOU run a dozen of DB servers, YOU don't want another one, YOU don't trust 
MySQL, YOU say KDE 4.4 is inappropriate for stable. Nothing objective and YOU 
assume that your truth is an ultimate one. Pet bugs are always RC to the 
reporter, but yet again, we need to face reality here. If YOU have so many 
problems with particular piece of software, look for better options or read 
the first part of this mail again.
