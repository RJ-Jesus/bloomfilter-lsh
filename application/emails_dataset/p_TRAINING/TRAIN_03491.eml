Yes, I am sure of that.
I printed all the steps on the output to check:
# Create stream 
## Schedule stream 
### Start stream 
[stuff happens]
#### Stop stream 
##### Invalidate stream 
###### Release stream 
# Create stream 
## Schedule stream 
### Start stream 
[...]
#### Stop stream 
##### Invalidate stream 
###### Release stream 
I don't unschedule the stream from the run loop since I invalidate it.

All the stream related stuff is happening on the same thread (at least for now).
Plus, in my example, I don't create a new stream after deleting the first one (since I have nothing left to watch).
It seems to me the stream may not be properly closed, or it is trying to access something that doesn't exist anymore.
But I am following all the steps for properly stopping and releasing the stream.
