"Currently, I am doing some research for the telivision programme 
"An Tuath Nua"  (which is broadcast by TG4) , and I saw that the
Linux Beer Hike will be in Doolin this year. We'd be intrested 
in including a report on the hike in the programme - will yourself
or anyone else with Irish be on the Hike do you know ?
Thanks for your help."
