Folks, the summerâs upon us here in the nationâs capital. And, matching the 
weather, your representatives are heatedly working to improve the Wall Street 
mess. Letâs hope they donât make it worse. Jennifer Hickey tells all in her 
revealing Washingtonâs Week piece http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html. 
And Zoli Simon has discovered that the Chinese have targeted Russian cruise 
missiles at U.S. ships. Read all about it

become a major force in time for the November elections? Hint â Itâs not the

WASHINGTONâS WEEK â ON THE LEGISLATIVE WARPATH

danced and ululated to mutual charges of chicanery.

TAX CODE TRAUMA
John Berlau tells us that experts contend that simplifying the U.S. tax code

introduction of still more regulations and criminal penalties.

               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?
On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded "red alert" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a "worst case scenario" -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:
