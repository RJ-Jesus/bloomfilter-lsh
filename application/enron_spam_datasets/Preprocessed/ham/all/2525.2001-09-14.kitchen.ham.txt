brad ,
it looks like i have taken back control of the tfs europe deal . i have received confirmation from each of the different desks that this is something they are willing to pursue . i went back to alan kurzer ( president of tfs ) with 300 , 000 euros ( about $ 265 k usd ) for continental power , uk power and int ' l . coal . he didn ' t bite so i told him to show me a bid . i ' ll let you know how it goes . i ' ve got a call into mark greenberg about the contractual issues . it should be something we can address in the amendment .
