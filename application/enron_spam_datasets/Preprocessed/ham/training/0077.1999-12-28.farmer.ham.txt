according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however , there is
nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i checked
mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate of
7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ?
thanks , stella
