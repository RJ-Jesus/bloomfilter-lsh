 Bloom-Filter + MinHash
========================

Overview
--------

Bloom-Filter + MinHash is a project which implements and uses both of concepts. It is currently being developed while we take "MPEI - Métodos Probabilísticos para Engenharia Informática".

Special Notes
-------------

Our current in use hash function ([MurmurHash3](https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3)) is interfaced with a MEX function, thus it needs to be compiled:

```mex MurmurHash3.cpp```

#### TO-DO: Get an idea of what to use this project with.
