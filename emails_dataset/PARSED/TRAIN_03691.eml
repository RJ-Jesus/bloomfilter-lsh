512 MB.  And I am pretty sure that it _is_ the problem - shutting things down 
(particularly Iceweasel tabs) sorts it out.  The motherboard could take more 
memory and I have an empty slot; but I am not sure that I can justify 
spending Â£30.00 on more memory for a motherboard that is definitely past the 
first flush of youth!
