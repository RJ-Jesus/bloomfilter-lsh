SUBJECT: synaptics touchpad stopped working in gnome

Hi List
i'm running sid on a msi wind 100 with synaptics touchpad. 
since my last dist-upgrade yesterday, the touchpad is not working in
gnome anymore, but still works fine in gdm-greeter, lxde and on console.
anyone else seeing this? any ideas against which packet to file a bug?
thanks
