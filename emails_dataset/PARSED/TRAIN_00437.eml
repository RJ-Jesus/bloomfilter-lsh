Recently I was trying to show my 15 year old granddaughter, who runs Open SuSU 
11 on her laptop, how to do some small admin job.  She said that she didn't 
want to know.  When I queried this, she said:

"When I am at school, the IT department does it for me.  When I am at home 
here, you do it for me.  When I am in Japan, Daddy does it for me.  Why do I 
need to know how to do it?"
