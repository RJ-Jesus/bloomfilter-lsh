As I mentioned in a later mail. And the specific behaviour is also 
different. But there shouldn't be any problem in 
installing/upgrading/removing/packages with one or the other tool.

Last time I experimented with cron-apt it did mention that aptitude is 
not really supported. But I don't see a problem in letting it use 
apt-get and doing your own package management with aptitude.
