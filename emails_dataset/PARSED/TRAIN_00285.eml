NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST: 
On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late Eng.Tony Morris, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter was returned undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address on the WILL. I wish to notify you that late Eng.Tony Morris made you a beneficiary to his WILL. He left the sum of Two Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD$2,200.000.00) to you in the codicil and last testament to his will. 

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and true. Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who wished you good. Eng.Tony Morris until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers. He was a very dedicated Christian who loved to give out. His great philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his lifetime. Late Eng.Tony Morris died on the 20th day of February 2008 at the age of 92 years and his WILL is now ready for execution.


According to him, this money is to support his Christian activities (May his soul rest with the Lord) and to help the poor and needy. 

Please if I reach, you as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable me conclude my job. I hope to hear from you in no distant date. Please contact me NOW

yours in His service, 

Barrister Vikason Ford Esq.
