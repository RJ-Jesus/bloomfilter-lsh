Actually, the "x" permission on a directory means "search" (i.e. find  
a file in) the directory.  If you already know the name (or have  
guessed it) of a file in the directory and you have "--x" (no-read, no- 
write, yes-search) on the directory and 'r--' (read-only) on the file,  
you can read the file even though you can't read the directory.   
That's a feature, and it dates back to early days in UNIX.

What you are seeing is a corner case caused by that feature.  If you  
have "r--" on the directory you can read it, but you can't find any of  
the files whose names you can read.  So you can't get those files  
permission bits or mod-time's etc.  So "ls" fails in the bizarre way  
you are seeing.

So you can "read" the directory without the "x" bit, but it doesn't do  
you a fat load of good.

Enjoy!

Rick
