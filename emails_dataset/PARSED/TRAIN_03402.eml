Please, please, don't do this.

In 4.4, kmail depends on mysql-server in order to send mail. (kmail -> Akonadi 
-> mysql-server).

In 4.3, this is not true.  From what I hear on upstream mailing lists, this 
won't be true in 4.5.  Upstream is already aware and working on the issue, but 
it falls under "new feature" so it won't be included in the 4.4.x line.

For me, KDE 4.4 is the most broken KDE release since 4.1 (I didn't try 4.0).  
I'd rather have 4.3.x in Squeeze than 4.4.

Actually, I like most of KDE 4.4 and am currently using it for day-to-day 
work.  I'm still using kmail/kontact/etc. (basically kdepim) from 4.3 since I 
have no desire to run yet another RDBMS on my system.  (I already run 
PostgreSQL, and have a number of apps that use SQLite installed.)

Please don't force an "Akonadi-enabled" PIM suite on stable users before they 
are provided with an Akonadi that can use something other than MySQL.
