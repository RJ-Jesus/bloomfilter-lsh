But I have to _look_ at them to turn them off.  In KDE 3 I do not.  I can turn 
them off without ever having to see them.

Bully for your mother and your autistics.  They make me feel sick and trigger 
a bad headache.

They do not.  They are much more complicated than in KDE 3 and you have to 
type more to be offered anything.

No, it's alt+F1 in KDE 3.5.x.  Alt+F5, which I also like and use a lot, brings 
up a list of running windows.

But I don't _like_ KDE 4 and I do, very much, like KDE 3.  I like Kcontrol 
better than those work-arounds.

Why?  You will only tell me that I have not got your petrmission to 
dislike/miss whatever it is.

I have not evaded the question.  I have pointed out that I prefer things that 
are functional to things that are showy.  As I stated at the beginning.  As 
someone else has pointed out, KDE 4 has had 2 years to become half way 
bearable and has signally failed.  I mourn the passing of KDE 3.5.x, which I 
regard as the pinnacle of DE's.  In other words, we have come full circle and 
are back at the beginning.  You have to learn to accept that not everyone 
agrees with you.

And, I fear that the lengths you are going to to try and persuade me that I am 
wrong, even to the extent of telling me that I am only allowed to be made ill 
by something that also makes your mother ill, do not strike me as helping me.
