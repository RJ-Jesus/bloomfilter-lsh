$ /sbin/modinfo ecb
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.32-4-amd64/kernel/crypto/ecb.ko
description:    ECB block cipher algorithm
license:        GPL
depends:        
vermagic:       2.6.32-4-amd64 SMP mod_unload modversions 

(I use the full path because modinfo is in /sbin, which is usually not 
in the user's $PATH).

But if you are curious only about the hardware related modules lspci 
will tell what modules are used by the respective hardware. You will 
need to run it as root with the -vvv parameters.

Andrei
