You missed my point completely. What is subjectively unusable for you, is 
perfectly usable for others and the other way round. Debian is not your 
personal distro, it strives to keep balance. And balance is towards 4.4 side 
you like it or not due to many factors. When Squeeze is released, KDE 4.5 may 
be in .3 or later patch release upstream so the point about the latest and 
greatest here is completely out-of-place.

Now if at particular time upstream software does not meet your personal needs, 
you go and look for alternatives. You talk like kdepim 4.3 was flawless. But 
it wasn't! There is no place for "software does not do X, remove it from 
stable" discussions here.

Insisting that others do something (revert to kdepim 4.3) based solely on your 
personal grievances does not help productive communication.

I've never said that you're the only one. I find myself in the odd position 
that I mostly share opinion with you about excessive "explosion" of DB server 
instances on the desktop but I still can't help myself to argue. You started 
this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your needs.

What facts? That kdepim/kmail needs akonadi? That's hardly news. Akonadi 
integration is not stable enough? There is still time to improve it. That's 
what Ana's blog was about.

It is not like every mail client on the market suddenly needs MySQL. Actually, 
kmail is probably unique in this area.

What I tried to say to you all this time, if Akonadi renders Kmail unusable to 
you, switch the client! Akonadi by itself is not a bug, it is not going away! 
Take it or switch to something else, simple as that.
