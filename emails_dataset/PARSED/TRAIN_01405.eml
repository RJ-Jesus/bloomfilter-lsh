At a pub frequented by the members of the EU translator corps,
a Spanish translator and an Irish translator start comparing
notes.  The Spanish translator asks, "Is there anything in Irish
Gaelic which corresponds to 'ma√±ana'?"  The Irishman thinks for
a moment, fortified by a long pull at his pint, and finally
responds, "Yes -- but it doesn't have the same sense of terrible
urgency."
