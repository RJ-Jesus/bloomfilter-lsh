It appears that the binding for SeditBeautify applies to
more than just the sedit window. Since SeditBeautify assumes
we are in a sedit window the routine fails. (Try typing
ctrl-l over the main window to see what I mean).

The quick fix for this is to make the ^l more restrictive. However, I'd
suggest keeping things the way the are and extending ^l to be a
highlight toggle. If the window is currently highlighted (sedit or msg)
re-display without highlighting and vice versa.

While I can hack tcl, hacking tk is another story. Translation: I can't 
fix this bug myself. Any volunteers?
