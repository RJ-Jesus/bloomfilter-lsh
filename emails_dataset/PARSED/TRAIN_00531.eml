SUBJECT: AUGD: Seeking Australian Apple User Groups

Over at AppleUsers.org, we have been updating our list of active Apple  
User Groups in Australia as we’ve recently seen one group fold,  
another start up and a few whose details had changed and we thought  
this would be an opportune time to seek any other active Apple User  
Groups that may wish to be included in our listings.

In particular, we are looking for any groups in Tasmania (after all,  
the Apple Isle should have Apple User Groups :) ) and in the Northern  
Territory as we have no active groups recorded for those regions at  
present.

We are also interested in hearing from ‘PC-based’ groups that also  
have Special Interest Groups for Mac, iPod, iPhone or iPad users.
Or maybe you are a U3A or Seniors Computer Club that has a dedicated  
session for the users of Apple products? If so, we are happy to  
include you in our listing.

To see if your group is listed with us, visit the AppleUsers.org User  
Group Listing page and if your group isn’t listed, we don’t know about  
you :( So fill in the form at the bottom of the page and we’ll add you.

If your group is listed, you might as well take the opportunity to  
confirm that we have your web address correctly listed. If we don’t,  
then just fill out the form again.
