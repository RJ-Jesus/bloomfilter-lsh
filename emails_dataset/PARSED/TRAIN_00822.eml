SUBJECT: Debian and touch-screens

Hi all.

I´m working in a project that we would like to install in a touch-screen compact computer. My intention is to use Debian as the OS, and i'm searching for that kind of hardware with support for Debian/Linux. Most of them support Windows but it´s not clear if Debian will work as well. I've found some support for touch screens (some models), but not clear for integrated/compact systems. Someone knows where to look for?, or has some experience?, some URL?

Thanks in advance,
