Well: Thats what I mean. Do you *understand* whats going on there?

I am a Linux trainer, consultant and administrator since >5 years and 
still don't get *why* this happen and *what* it triggers. I might get it 
when I study MySQL, DBUS, Resource Agents, Nepomuk, *whatever* else it 
uses - but I am and I want to be *just a user* of this stuff. 

So I think this is for upstream to solve - and if it ain't work reliably 
in KDE 4.4 I think it has to be fixed within KDE 4.4 series. Akonadi might 
use MySQL or not, but it if uses it, KAddressBook should still just work 
*predictably*.

Thus I suggest reporting anything like that upstream - especially to you, 
Boyd - complaining here probably just won't help. And if upstream does not 
get bug reports they probably don't even know that something is broken on 
probably only *some* systems.

Some issues might be packaging related, but then I hope to get hints back 
from upstream developers so that I can file debian bug reports with proper 
suggestions. Until then I think I default to reporting upstream, unless 
someone convinces me to do elsewise.

Ciao,
