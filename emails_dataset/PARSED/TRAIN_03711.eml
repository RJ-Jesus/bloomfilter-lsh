SUBJECT: EOL of KDE SC 4.4.2 in qt-kde.debian.net

Hello,

KDE SC 4.4.2 packages in qt-kde.debian.net have been superseded by packages 
uploaded to official Debian experimental archive and therefore they were 
removed from the semi-official repository. As it was written on the 
introductory page of qt-kde.debian.net, the repository itself will remain to 
exist and might get some random extremely bleeding edge updates from time to 
time. Feel free to keep it in your /etc/apt/sources.list.
