 	  An island getaway
An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
for movie stars Ethan Hawke

and Uma Thurman

and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination. 

 	 
 	
 	

 	 	 	
 	
 	  

British boys reserved?
Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow
 ,
currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: "British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake." Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt

and Ben Affleck
 ,
admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
accepted with pleasure. One of her "very charming" dates was actor James
Purefoy
 ,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

 	 
 	
 	

 	 	 	
 	
 	  

A one-on-one interview
Muscle-bound Vin Diesel
 ,
star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was "available".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
day.
