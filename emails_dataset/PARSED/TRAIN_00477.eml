Hmm.

Using KDE 4 for months now; currently 4.4 from experimental.  If that's 
what'll end up in squeeze I wouldn't say "it has problems" in general.  KDE 
certainly is far from bug-free, but it's very usable as an everyday desktop.
( Sune & Co: you can consider this a general reportbug --kudos :-)

lrhorer: I recommend you update to the packages that are currently in 
experimental and check if the problems are still there.  I'm sure bug 
reports are welcome.  If you can be bothered to do the necessary work and 
separately report packaging issues to the Debian bts and KDE 4.4 issues to 
the KDE bug reporting sysstem, then all the better..

cheers
