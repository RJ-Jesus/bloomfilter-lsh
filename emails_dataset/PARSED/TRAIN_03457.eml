SUBJECT: pinentry window?

Heyho!

... and, sending the last mail: is it a Debian specific issue, or some local 
feature of my KDE profile, or a KDE bug: recently (4.3 to 4.4, but I'm not 
sure exactly which updates triggered it), the pinentry window always comes 
up behind the kmail windows when I sign email.  Confused me a bit at 
first... (luckily it is still modal relative to the kmail window, so the 
kmail composer gets greyed out, indicating that the pinentry might be 
somewhere...)

Mostly everything related to KDE is experimental or qt-kde repository. 
pinentry-qt4 is 0.8.0-1.

cheers
