No, they just don't exist on mailing lists.  Some KDE 3.5 installations are 
used by people that probably would have problems getting Debian installed and 
would think that "Bugzilla" was a B movie.

It would be nice if KDE got input from all it's users.  Sometimes it gets 100s 
of users input from a rant from a single email address (their KDE 
administrator).  Luckily, these events can be written off as 
"just one user's opinion".  :P  The rantor is then summarily dismissed because 
they can't put in another 40 hours a week fixing the issues, since they are 
already overworked with the job administering a large KDE 3.5 installation.  
:P

I'm convinced real users exist.  I just don't use my computer like them.

Based on the evidence presented (NB: I have not independently verified it), 
the developers write what they want and then use something else.  You may find 
that ironic, but that doesn't automatically make it untrue.
