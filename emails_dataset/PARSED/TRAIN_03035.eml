Supporting and testing unreleased or beta software is the biggest problem. If 
you want your pet issue fixed, you have to get akonadi from trunk, build it, 
test whole Debian's KDE 4.4.x *extensively* with it including third party 
akonadi plugins like googledata one. Finally severe regressions should be 
fixed. For packaging, README.Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB 
backends since there won't be GUI for it. And when this is done, that akonadi 
could be considered for stable.

In other words, you have to do part of upstream release management work 
without knowing the code well. You can be sure that upstream won't be pleased 
with Debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi. But maybe you can 
convince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate Debian needs. There 
is lots of work to be done.

Initial akonadi trunk packaging is at [1]. I have been using it with SQLite 
for over a month now. Yet I don't use akonadi features extensively (not even 
addressbook or korganizer) so I can't tell much about quality of the code. But 
I can tell you that if you don't step up, this plan probably won't make it.

It might be a problem for some people (short on RAM on their machines), not a 
problem for others. Generally, you need to stop talking and generalizing what 
you don't know (like keep claiming that releasing with different versions 
wasn't considered despite obvious proof on the contrary).

PostgreSQL/SQLite is a FEATURE, it is not a bug which has to be fixed no 
matter what. If you want it in, stop ranting and start working on it. Give 
fewer lessons how Debian works and actually do something useful towards your 
goal. Especially since the lack of technical knowledge or background should 
not be the problem for you.
