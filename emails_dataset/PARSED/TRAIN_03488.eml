The kernel from lenny-backports, testing, or sid will probably be using the 
same device naming as Ubuntu.

Likely it is not using UUIDs trying to be compatible with initramfs-es or 
other systems that don't like them.  But, as you've seen, using the "raw" 
device name doesn't really help either.  Different kernel versions, and even 
kernels compiled with different options, will use different "raw" names for 
the devices.  In odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot as 
devices are (now) discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names in a 
different order based how quickly they respond to the kernel.
