SUBJECT: Re: AUGD: Have You Thanked Your Volunteers?

My current group is too small to worry about thanking them in any  
major way.  Of we all thank each other.  We have 4 regular volunteers  
and currently having a different member each month volunteering to do  
a presentation.  Only occasionally having an outside speaker.  
Sometimes via iChat.

When I was with HAUS in Honolulu, we thanked the volunteers by buying  
them pizza each month at the board meetings.  In Boston, we had an  
annual meeting of "activists".  400 strong.  Then we had an annual  
picnic for volunteers as well.

I think it never hurts to thank people every chance you can get.
