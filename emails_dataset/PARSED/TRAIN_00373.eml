Sounds like a bug to me.  Not exactly high-priority, but a bug nonetheless.

Well, does this only happen with tooltips from a single application?  Multiple 
related applications (e.g. multiple Qt-4 applications)?  Every application?

Single -> that app.
Multiple -> that library / related "thing".  Or any one of the applications, 
but include information about which other applications are affected.
Every -> Probably your window manager, maybe X.
