I don't find that to be true at all.  For non-removable media except / you can 
simply use UUIDs everything should be fine.  For / you can generally use a 
UUID, too.  Removable media can be handled in a variety of ways.  I prefer 
using udev to fill in any gaps; writing udev rules doesn't really require 
familiarity with hardware (udev will tell you everything useful) and there are 
some descent guides available.
