NB: This is my best recollection; I'm not looking this up right now.  Please 
check my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.

Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, which 
I believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came 
from tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and 
should be in btrfs.  The final edge reiserfs had was above-average 
flushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs have 
likely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching 
system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.

Not really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very 
long time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated to 
use the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that 
will not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the 
reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on the 
ext2/3/4 or xfs code.

In addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less 
attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate away 
from it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outside 
of generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which 
allows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying; 
such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system and 
fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The 
source will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in file 
systems are not interested in reiserfs.

There's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no 
pressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file 
systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiserfs.
